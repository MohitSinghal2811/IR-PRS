You can use the HTTP_REFERER value:

from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect

return HttpResponseRedirect(request.META.get('HTTP_REFERER', '/'))
Note that this will not work if the client disabled sending referrer information (for example, using a private/incognito browser Window). In such a case it will redirect to /.
